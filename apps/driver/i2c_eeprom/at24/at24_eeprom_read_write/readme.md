# I2C EEPROM AT24 driver - EEPROM Read Write

This example application shows how to use the AT24 driver to perform read and write operations on AT24 series of EEPROM.

## Description

- This example uses the AT24 driver to communicate with I2C based AT24MAC402 series EEPROMs to perform write and read operations.

## Downloading and building the application

To clone or download this application from Github, go to the [main page of this repository](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/core_apps_pic32ck_sg_gc) and then click **Clone** button to clone this repository or download as zip file.
This content can also be downloaded using content manager by following these [instructions](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/contentmanager/wiki).

Path of the application within the repository is **apps/driver/i2c_eeprom/at24/at24_eeprom_read_write/firmware**

To build the application, refer to the following table and open the project using its IDE.

## Setting up the hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

| Project Name| Board|
|:---------|:---------:|
| pic32ck_gc01_cult.X    | [PIC32CK-GC01 Curiosity Ultra board]()|
|||

### Setting up [PIC32CK-GC01 Curiosity Ultra board]()

- To run the demo, the following additional hardware are required:
  - One [EEPROM 3 Click](https://www.mikroe.com/eeprom-3-click) board
- Connect [EEPROM 3 Click](https://www.mikroe.com/eeprom-3-click) board on the mikroBUS header
- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1. Build and program the application using its IDE
2. LED is turned ON when the data read from EEPROM matches with the written data

Refer to the following table for LED name:

| Board | LED Name |
| ----- | -------- |
|  [PIC32CK-GC01 Curiosity Ultra board]() | LED0 |
