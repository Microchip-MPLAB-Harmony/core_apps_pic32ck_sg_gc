# I2C Driver Asynchronous - Multi-client

This example application demonstrates the multi-client feature of the asynchronous mode<br /> of the I2C driver by communicating with an external EEPROM and a temperature sensor.

**Parent topic:**[Harmony 3 Driver, System Services and RTOS Application Examples for PIC32CK GC/SG Family](GUID-CDB24A84-49B8-4114-B4EF-E80CFD24D7D9.md)

## Description

This example uses the I2C driver in asynchronous mode and demonstrates the<br /> multi-client feature. The example uses a [IO1 Xplained Pro Extension Kit](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/ATIO1-XPRO) that has a<br /> temperature sensor and an EEPROM, both interfaced on the same I2C bus.

Two application tasks are created which act as clients to the same instance of the<br /> I2C driver:

APP\_I2C\_TEMP\_SENSOR\_Tasks:

Reads temperature every 1 second, prints on console and notifies the EEPROM client.<br /> The Time System Service is used to generate a callback every 1 second

APP\_I2C\_EEPROM\_Tasks:

Writes temperature values to the EEPROM once the temperature read complete<br /> notification is received. The task also reads and prints the last five saved<br /> temperature data from the EEPROM when user enters any key on the console.

### Setting Up PIC32CK GC01 Curiosity Ultra Development Board

-   To run the demo, the following additional hardware are required:
    -   [IO1 Xplained Pro Extension Kit](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/ATIO1-XPRO)
-   Connect the [IO1 Xplained Pro Extension Kit](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/ATIO1-XPRO) to the EXT1 header
-   Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1.  Open the Terminal application \(Ex.:Tera term\) on the computer.
2.  Connect to the PKOB4 Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    -   Baud : 115200
    -   Data : 8 Bits
    -   Parity : None
    -   Stop : 1 Bit
    -   Flow Control : None
3.  Build the application using its IDE
4.  Observe the temperature values getting printed on the terminal application every 1 second and temperature value written into EEPROM notification as shown below
5.  Press any key on the terminal, last 5 temperature values will be read from the EEPROM and displayed as shown below
