# FAT File System using SST26 Media

This application shows an example of using the FAT File System to access SQI based SST26<br /> flash media.

**Parent topic:**[Harmony 3 Driver, System Services and RTOS Application Examples for PIC32CK GC/SG Family](GUID-CDB24A84-49B8-4114-B4EF-E80CFD24D7D9.md)

## Description

### File System Operations on the On-Board SST26 Flash Memory:

-   Performs a SYS\_FS\_FormatDisk
-   Opens a **newfile.txt** on the SST26 flash
-   Write and reads back 4KB of data on **newfile.txt**
-   Verifies the Data Read back

### File System Layer Uses:

-   One instance of the Memory driver is used to communicate with the On-Board SQI Flash memory
