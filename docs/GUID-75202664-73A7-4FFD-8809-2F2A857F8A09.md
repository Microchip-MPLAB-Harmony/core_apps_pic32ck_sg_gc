# SPI EEPROM AT25 Driver - EEPROM Read Write

This example application shows how to use the AT25 driver to perform read and write<br /> operations on AT25 series of EEPROM.

**Parent topic:**[Harmony 3 Driver, System Services and RTOS Application Examples for PIC32CK GC/SG Family](GUID-CDB24A84-49B8-4114-B4EF-E80CFD24D7D9.md)

## Description

This example uses the AT25 driver to communicate with the SPI based AT25 series of<br /> external EEPROMs to perform write and read operations in Bare-Metal environment.

### Setting Up PIC32CK GC01 Curiosity Ultra Development Board

-   To run the demo, the following additional hardware are required:
    -   [EEPROM 4 click board](https://www.mikroe.com/eeprom-4-click)
-   Install an [EEPROM 4 click board](https://www.mikroe.com/eeprom-4-click) on to the mikroBUS header
-   Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1.  Build and program the application using its IDE
2.  The LED is turned ON when the value read from EEPROM matches with the written data

Refer to the following table for LED name:
