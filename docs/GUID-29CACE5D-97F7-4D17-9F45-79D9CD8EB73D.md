# SPI Driver Synchronous - Self Loopback Multi Client

This example demonstrates how to use the SPI driver in synchronous mode to achieve<br /> self-loop back between multiple clients in RTOS environment.

**Parent topic:**[Harmony 3 Driver, System Services and RTOS Application Examples for PIC32CK GC/SG Family](GUID-CDB24A84-49B8-4114-B4EF-E80CFD24D7D9.md)

## Description

This example writes and reads back the same data \(self loop back\) for two different<br /> clients connected over the same SPI bus by using the multi client feature of a<br /> synchronous SPI driver. The example also demonstrates how to setup two different<br /> client transfers at two different baud rates.

The example has three RTOS threads for the purpose:

-   **APP\_CLIENT1\_Tasks**: This thread opens the SPI driver instance and performs a continuous loop back transfer. If the loop back is successful, the loop back is repeated every 100 ms. In case of an error, the thread closes the driver and suspends itself.
-   **APP\_CLIENT2\_Tasks**: This thread opens the SPI driver instance and performs a continuous loop back transfer. If the loop back is successful, the loop back is repeated every 100 ms. In case of an error, the thread closes the driver and suspends itself.
-   **APP\_MONITOR\_Tasks**: This thread checks the status of loop back done by the two client tasks and turns on the LED if the loop back transfer status reported by both the clients is successful.
