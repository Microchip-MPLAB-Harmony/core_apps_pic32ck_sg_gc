# Time System Service Multi-client

This example application demonstrates the multi-client system timer functionality

**Parent topic:**[Harmony 3 Driver, System Services and RTOS Application Examples for PIC32CK GC/SG Family](GUID-CDB24A84-49B8-4114-B4EF-E80CFD24D7D9.md)

## Description

-   This application demonstrates timer functionality \(with two clients to the Time System Service\) by periodically printing a message on console every two seconds and blinking an LED every one second
-   Delay, counter and single shot timer functionality is demonstrated on a switch press
-   On a switch press, the application reads the current value of the 64 bit counter \(say, count 1\)
-   It then starts a delay of 500 milliseconds and waits for the delay to expire
-   Once the delay has expired, the application again reads the current value of the 64 bit counter \(say, count 2\) and calculates the difference between the two counter values
-   The difference count indicates the time spent for the delay and is printed on the console as, â€œDelay time = x msâ€?, where x is the delay value and is equal to 500 milliseconds in the given example
-   The application then starts a single shot timer of 100 milliseconds
-   When the single shot timer expires, a message is printed on the console that says â€œSingle shot timer of 100 ms expiredâ€?
-   This message is printed only once on every switch press

### Setting Up PIC32CK GC01 Curiosity Ultra Development Board

-   Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1.  Open the Terminal application \(Ex.:Tera term\) on the computer
2.  Connect to the PKOB4 Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    -   Baud : 115200
    -   Data : 8 Bits
    -   Parity : None
    -   Stop : 1 Bit
    -   Flow Control : None
3.  Build and Program the application using its IDE
4.  Observe the following message getting printed on the console every two seconds

5.  Press the switch and observe the following output on the terminal \(highlighted in red box\)

    ![](GUID-15854097-DD34-42FB-AA64-1AC66F5E318C-low.png)

    -   â€œDelay time = 500 msâ€? indicates the amount of time spent during the delay
    -   â€œSingle shot timer of 100 ms expiredâ€? is printed only once on every switch press
6.  LED indicates the periodic timer functionality
    -   LED is toggled periodically every one second

Refer to the following table for Switch and LED names:
