# FAT File System using SDMMC Media

This application shows an example of using the MPLAB Harmony File System to access and<br /> modify the contents of a SD card using the SDMMC driver

**Parent topic:**[Harmony 3 Driver, System Services and RTOS Application Examples for PIC32CK GC/SG Family](GUID-CDB24A84-49B8-4114-B4EF-E80CFD24D7D9.md)

## Description

### File System Operations on the SD Card:

-   Application opens a file named **FILE\_TOO\_LONG\_NAME\_EXAMPLE\_123.JPG** in the root directory of the SD card and reads its content into memory
    -   The image file could be any arbitrary JPEG \(image\) file chosen by the user and then renamed to **FILE\_TOO\_LONG\_NAME\_EXAMPLE\_123.JPG**
-   Application creates directory named **Dir1** in the root directory
-   Application creates a new file named **FILE\_TOO\_LONG\_NAME\_EXAMPLE\_123.JPG** inside **Dir1**
-   Application copies the content from step 1 into this newly created file

The reason for choosing a JPEG file for test purposes is that the duplicate file,<br /> **Dir1/FILE\_TOO\_LONG\_NAME\_EXAMPLE\_123.JPG** created by the demonstration<br /> could be easily verified for correctness.If the new file inside **Dir1**<br /> opens for viewing on the computer and matches to original image, the test is<br /> deemed to have passed. Otherwise, if the file does not open \(i.e., is<br /> corrupted\), the test will be considered to have failed.

**Note:** Since the application creates a directory named Dir1, it is important that the a folder with the same name does not exist on the SD card. If a directory named Dir1 is already present on the SD card, the application will fail.

### File System Layer Uses:

-   SDMMC Driver to communicate to SD Card

### Setting Up PIC32CK GC01 Curiosity Ultra Development Board

-   To run this application, following additional hardware is required
    -   One micro-sd card
    -   Create a new JPEG file in the SD Card with name **FILE\_TOO\_LONG\_NAME\_EXAMPLE\_123.JPG**
-   Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1.  Build and program the application using its IDE
2.  Insert the SD Card in the SD Card slot of the Device
3.  The LED is turned ON if there was no error during creating the directory and copying the file into it

    Refer to the following table for LED name:

    |Board|LED Name|
    |-----|--------|
    |[PIC32CK GC01 Curiosity Ultra Development Board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/ea23j82a)|LED0|

4.  If LED is ON, Insert the SD Card on to your host PC
5.  SD Card should have the file **Dir1/FILE\_TOO\_LONG\_NAME\_EXAMPLE\_123.JPG** and should match the original image
